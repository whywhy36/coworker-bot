# GitHub Quick Start

Get coworker-bot running with GitHub in ~10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+ (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) — install via `npm install -g pnpm` or the [standalone installer](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Crafting CLI (`cs`) installed and authenticated as an org admin

---

## 1. Create a GitHub bot account

Create a dedicated GitHub account for the agent (e.g. `my-org-bot`). This is the account that will post comments and open PRs.

> **Do not use your personal account.** The watcher skips events where the last comment is from the bot — using your own account would suppress your own events.

Add the bot as a collaborator on the repositories it needs to access.

---

## 2. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

Sign in as the bot account, then go to **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token**.

Required permissions:

- **Contents:** Read and write
- **Issues:** Read and write
- **Pull requests:** Read and write

Note the token value — you will use it in the next step.

---

## 3. Create secrets in Crafting

```bash
# Generate a webhook secret
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Create [secrets](https://docs.sandboxes.cloud/concepts/secret.html) for GitHub related information.

- `github-pat`
- `github-webhook-secret`

Create them using the below commands:

```bash
echo "YOUR_PAT" | cs secret create github-pat --shared -f -
echo "$GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET" | cs secret create github-webhook-secret --shared -f -
```

or using the Web Console.

## After creating each secret, make sure both secrets are marked as **Admin Only** and **Not Mountable**.

## 4. Configure template and start a Sandbox

Download the template into a local folder (gitignored, safe for customizations):

```bash
mkdir -p _local
curl -o _local/coworker-bot-quick-start.yaml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crafting-demo/coworker-bot/refs/heads/master/docs/examples/templates/coworker-bot-quick-start.yaml
```

Open `_local/coworker-bot-quick-start.yaml`. The two env vars `GITHUB_BOT_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORIES` are **auto-detected from the PAT** (bot username via `GET /user`, repositories via `GET /user/repos`) and can be left commented out. Uncomment and set them explicitly only if you want to override the auto-detected values.

Create the template and sandbox from the local file:

```bash
cs template create coworker-bot ./_local/coworker-bot-quick-start.yaml
cs sandbox create coworker-bot -t coworker-bot
cs sandbox pin coworker-bot
```

> **MUST pin the sandbox.** Without pinning, the sandbox suspends after inactivity and misses webhook events. Events received while suspended are lost.

---

## 5. Configure the GitHub webhook

Find your webhook URL: Web Console → Sandbox → Endpoints → "webhook"

In each monitored repository go to **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**:

| Field        | Value                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Payload URL  | `https://webhook--coworker-bot-<your-org>.sandboxes.site/webhook/github` |
| Content type | `application/json` ← **required**                                        |
| Secret       | webhook secret from Step 3                                               |
| Events       | Issues, Pull requests, Issue comments                                    |

---

## 6. Authorize MCP servers

Web Console → **Connect → LLM** → under **Sandboxes Authorized to Expose MCP Servers**, click **Add**, input the sandbox name `coworker-bot`, and confirm.

Without this step the agent cannot read issues or create PRs.

For more details, please refer to this [doc](https://docs.sandboxes.cloud/features/llm-config.html).

---

## 7. Verify

```bash
cs logs --workspace coworker-bot/dev --follow watcher
```

Create a test issue in one of your monitored repos. Within ~30 seconds the bot should comment: _"Agent is working on #\<number\>"_ and a Crafting Coding Agent session will start.
