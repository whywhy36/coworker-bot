/**
 * Provider interface for integrating with external platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Slack, etc.).
 *
 * Provider Lifecycle:
 * ==================
 *
 * 1. **Initialization** (once, during Watcher startup)
 *    - initialize() is called with provider configuration
 *    - Provider authenticates, validates config, sets up internal state
 *    - MUST succeed before any other methods are called
 *    - Failures here prevent the provider from being registered
 *
 * 2. **Event Reception** (ongoing, throughout runtime)
 *    - Two mechanisms: webhooks (real-time) and polling (periodic)
 *
 *    Webhook Flow:
 *    a) validateWebhook() - Verify request authenticity (HMAC signature, tokens, etc.)
 *    b) handleWebhook() - Parse payload, normalize event, call eventHandler
 *
 *    Polling Flow:
 *    a) poll() - Query provider API for new events
 *    b) For each event found: normalize and call eventHandler
 *
 * 3. **Shutdown** (once, during graceful shutdown)
 *    - shutdown() is called when Watcher stops
 *    - Provider should clean up resources (close connections, cancel timers, etc.)
 *    - Should complete quickly (within a few seconds)
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * ====================
 * - **Normalize Events**: Convert provider-specific payloads to NormalizedEvent format
 * - **Create Reactors**: Instantiate provider-specific Reactor for comment handling
 * - **Authenticate**: Validate incoming webhooks and authenticate API requests
 * - **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle API errors, rate limits, and network issues
 * - **Deduplication Support**: Provide Reactor that can check/post comments for deduplication
 *
 * Threading Model:
 * ================
 * - All methods may be called concurrently
 * - handleWebhook() may be called while poll() is running
 * - Providers must be thread-safe (use locks if needed)
 * - Each call to handleWebhook() or poll() should be independent
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * ===============
 * - Throw ProviderError for provider-specific errors
 * - Log detailed errors for debugging
 * - Don't crash on single event failures (log and continue)
 * - Return false from validateWebhook() for invalid signatures (don't throw)
