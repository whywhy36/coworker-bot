# Sandbox Template

This folder contains Crafting Sandbox templates for the coworker-bot agent. Each template references secrets using the `${secret:<name>}` syntax — these must be configured in your Crafting Sandbox before the sandbox will start successfully.

## How Secrets Work in Crafting Sandbox

Secrets are injected as environment variables at runtime. You configure them once in the Crafting Sandbox UI and reference them in templates as `${secret:<secret-name>}`.

To add a secret:

1. Open your Crafting Sandbox dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → Secrets**
3. Click **Add Secret**, enter the name and value, and save

The secret name must exactly match what is referenced in the template (e.g., `github-pat`, not `github_pat`).

## Secrets Reference

### `github-pat`

**Used as:** `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

A GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) used to authenticate the GitHub MCP server and webhook handler.

**How to create:**

1. Go to [github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Set an expiration and select the following scopes:
   - `repo` (full repository access)
   - `read:org` (if working with org repositories)
4. Click **Generate token** and copy the value immediately
5. Add it to Crafting Sandbox as secret name `github-pat`

> Note: Some templates use `github_pat` (underscore). Make sure the secret name in Crafting Sandbox matches what is referenced in the template you are using.

3. Copy the **Signing Secret**
4. Add it to Crafting Sandbox as secret name `slack-signing-secret`

---

### `jira-api-token`

**Used as:** `JIRA_API_TOKEN`

Used to authenticate the Jira provider for polling issues and posting comments. The token type and the corresponding `watcher.yaml` `auth` block depend on whether you are using **Jira Cloud** or **Jira Server / Data Center**, and whether the token belongs to a **personal account** or a dedicated **service account**.

---

#### Jira Cloud — API Token

Jira Cloud does not support password authentication for the REST API. The auth method depends on the account type:

- **Personal account** — API token + email address via HTTP Basic auth (`auth.type: basic`)
- **Service account** — scoped API token via Bearer auth (`auth.type: token`) with a different `baseUrl`

**Personal account**

Use this for local development or personal projects where the bot acts on your behalf.

1. Sign in to [Atlassian](https://id.atlassian.com) as yourself
2. Go to **Account Settings → Security → [API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)**
3. Click **Create API token**, enter a label (e.g., `coworker-bot`), and click **Create**
4. Copy the token immediately — it is shown only once
5. Add it to Crafting Sandbox as secret name `jira-api-token`

`watcher.yaml` auth block:
```yaml
auth:
  type: basic
  username: you@example.com      # your Atlassian account email
  tokenEnv: JIRA_API_TOKEN
```

**Service account (recommended for production)**

A service account is a dedicated Atlassian user that acts as the bot identity. Using one keeps bot activity separate from personal accounts and avoids disruption if team members leave.

Jira Cloud service accounts authenticate with a **scoped OAuth API token (Bearer)**, not Basic auth, and the REST API is accessed through the Atlassian API gateway using your Cloud ID rather than your regular Jira domain.

1. Create a new Atlassian account with a shared mailbox or alias (e.g., `coworker-bot@yourcompany.com`). If your organisation uses SSO, ask your Jira admin to create a **managed account** for the bot.
2. In Jira, add the service account as a member of each project it needs to access, with at minimum the **Service Desk Agent** or **Developer** role (enough to read issues and post comments).
3. Sign in to [Atlassian](https://id.atlassian.com) **as the service account** (use a private browser window or a separate browser profile).
4. Go to **Account Settings → Security → [API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)**
5. Click **Create API token**, enter a label (e.g., `coworker-bot-production`), and click **Create**
6. Copy the token immediately — it is shown only once
7. Add it to Crafting Sandbox as secret name `jira-api-token`

Find your Cloud ID (needed for `baseUrl`):
```bash
curl https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/_edge/tenant_info
# returns: {"cloudId":"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", ...}
```

`watcher.yaml` auth and options blocks:
```yaml
auth:
  type: token                   # Bearer token — no email field
  tokenEnv: JIRA_API_TOKEN

options:
  baseUrl: https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>   # NOT yourcompany.atlassian.net
  botUsername: "Coworker Bot"   # Required — auto-detection does not work for service accounts
```

> **Note:** `botUsername` must be set explicitly for service accounts. Auto-detection via `/rest/api/3/myself` does not return a usable display name for scoped service account tokens. The value must match the Jira display name of the bot account exactly (case-insensitive).

---

#### Jira Server / Data Center — Personal Access Token

Jira Server and Data Center use **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** for REST API authentication. A PAT is passed as a `Bearer` token — no email address is required (`auth.type: token`).

**Personal account**

1. Sign in to your Jira Server / DC instance as yourself
2. Click your avatar (top-right) → **Profile → Personal Access Tokens**
3. Click **Create token**, enter a name and an optional expiry date, then click **Create**
4. Copy the token immediately — it is shown only once
5. Add it to Crafting Sandbox as secret name `jira-api-token`

`watcher.yaml` auth block:
```yaml
auth:
  type: token
  tokenEnv: JIRA_API_TOKEN
```

**Service account (recommended for production)**

1. Ask your Jira admin to create a dedicated local user (e.g., `coworker-bot`) in **Jira → User Management**. The account does not need administrator rights — grant it the **Developer** or **Service Desk Agent** role in each target project.
2. Sign in to Jira **as the service account**.
3. Click the avatar → **Profile → Personal Access Tokens**
4. Click **Create token**, enter a name (e.g., `coworker-bot-production`) and an optional expiry, then click **Create**
5. Copy the token immediately — it is shown only once
6. Add it to Crafting Sandbox as secret name `jira-api-token`

`watcher.yaml` auth block:
```yaml
auth:
  type: token
  tokenEnv: JIRA_API_TOKEN
```

> **Note:** Jira Server / DC PATs are tied to the user who created them. If the account is disabled or the token expires, the bot will stop authenticating. Set a calendar reminder to rotate the token before expiry, or leave the expiry blank for a non-expiring token (check your organisation's security policy).

### `jira-webhook-secret`

**Used as:** `JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

Used to verify that incoming webhook payloads are genuinely from Jira. Jira Cloud signs payloads with an HMAC-SHA256 signature using this secret. See [Secure admin webhooks — Atlassian](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/webhooks/#secure-admin-webhooks) for details.

**How to get:**

1. Go to Jira → **Settings → System → WebHooks → Create a WebHook**
2. Jira generates a secret for you — copy it after creation
3. Add it to Crafting Sandbox as secret name `jira-webhook-secret`
